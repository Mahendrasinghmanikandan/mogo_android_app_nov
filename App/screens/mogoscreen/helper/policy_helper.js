For all products, the returns/replacement policy provided on the product page shall prevail over the general returns policy. Do refer the respective item's applicable return/replacement policy on the product page for any exceptions to this returns policy and the table below
    
The return policy is divided into three parts; Do read all sections carefully to understand the conditions and cases under which returns will be accepted.

Part 1 – Category, Return Window and Actions possible

Part 2 - Returns Pick-Up and Processing In case of returns where you would like item(s) to be picked up from a different address, the address can only be changed if pick-up service is available at the new address During pick-up, your product will be checked for the following conditions:

The field executive will refuse to accept the return if any of the above conditions are not met.

For any products for which a refund is to be given, the refund will be processed once the returned product has been received by the seller.

Part 3 - General Rules for a successful Return
    
In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.

In cases where a product accessory is found missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller’s discretion.

During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be applicable. Click here to know more about Open Box Delivery

For products where installation is provided by TheMogo's service partners, do not open the product packaging by yourself. TheMogo authorised personnel shall help in unboxing and installation of the product.
For Furniture, any product-related issues will be checked by authorised service personnel (free of cost) and attempted to be resolved by replacing the faulty/ defective part of the product. Full replacement will be provided only in cases where the service personnel opines that replacing the faulty/defective part will not resolve the issue.'
